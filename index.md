## Intro

I am Juan Vásquez (he/him), a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Colorado Boulder, and I am being supervised by Dr. Maria L. Pacheco and Dr. Alexis Palmer.

I am part of [BLAST](https://tr.ee/Smrg77IVE4) and LECS, where I am currently working on neurosymbolic approaches to NLP. Our goal is to combine symbolic rules and methods with neural models to take advantage of the modeling capabilities displayed by both paradigms, and create more robust, efficient and explainable NLP models.

During my master's, I worked on heteronormative language detection, and hate-speech detection in Mexican Spanish under the supervision of Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix and Dr. Karla Ramírez Pulido.

In 2023, I worked as a consultant for the University of Arizona. I collaborated with Dr. Javier Osorio on automatic classification of news articles related to organized crime in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.


## Some more info about me

In my free time I enjoy playing J-RPGs, watching horror films and reading contemporary Latin-American and queer literature.

## Media


Media objects are supported, like images and video:

![[The Center of the Web (1914), Wikimedia](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:The_Center_of_the_Web_(1914).webm/11)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/The_Center_of_the_Web_%281914%29.webm)

They extend to the width of the page, and add appropriate padding in the bottom to maintain the monospace grid.

## Discussion

That's it for now.
I've very much enjoyed making this, pushing my CSS chops and having a lot of fun with the design.
If you like it or even decide to use it, please [let me know](https://x.com/owickstrom).

Finally, a massive shout-out to [U.S. Graphics Company](https://x.com/usgraphics) for all the inspiration.
